# Printful Integration

## Overview

Hermes integrates with Printful, a print-on-demand fulfillment service, allowing you to:

- **Sync Products** - Import Printful's catalog directly into your store
- **Manage Inventory** - Let Printful handle stock management
- **Create Orders** - Automatically send customer orders to Printful for fulfillment
- **Track Shipments** - Receive real-time updates on order status and tracking information
- **Multi-variant Support** - Offer products with multiple sizes, colors, and customizations

## Architecture

### Components

1. **PrintfulClient** (`src/lib/server/integrations/printful/client.ts`)
   - Low-level API communication with Printful
   - Handles authentication and error handling
   - Methods for products, variants, orders

2. **PrintfulService** (`src/lib/server/integrations/printful/service.ts`)
   - High-level business logic
   - Product syncing
   - Inventory checks
   - Order creation and management

3. **Database Layer** (`src/lib/server/integrations/printful/db.ts`)
   - Stores Printful product and order data
   - Tracks sync state
   - Links Hermes products to Printful products

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/admin/printful/sync` - Sync products from Printful
   - `GET /api/admin/printful/status` - Check Printful connection status
   - `POST /api/webhooks/printful` - Receive order status updates

## Setup

### 1. Get Printful API Key

1. Sign in to [Printful Dashboard](https://printful.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Account** → **API**
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the API key (you'll need it in the next step)

### 2. Create Printful Provider in Hermes

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → **Fulfillment Providers**
2. Click **Add Provider**
3. **Name**: Enter a name (e.g., "Printful Store")
4. **Type**: Select **Printful**
5. Click **Create Provider**

### 3. Configure API Key

1. On the provider card, click **Configure**
2. Paste your Printful API key
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify it works
4. Click **Sync Products** to import Printful's catalog

### 4. Setup Webhook (Optional but Recommended)

For real-time order updates:

1. Go to Printful Dashboard → **Account** → **Webhooks**
2. Add new webhook:
   - **URL**: `https://your-store.com/api/webhooks/printful`
   - **Events**: Select all order-related events
   - **Test connection** to verify

## Usage

### Creating Products with Printful

1. In admin dashboard, create a new product
2. Under **Fulfillment Options**, add Printful provider
3. Select a Printful product and variant
4. Set your markup/profit margin
5. Save product

### Placing Orders

When a customer places an order with Printful fulfillment:

1. Order is validated and inventory checked
2. Order data is sent to Printful API
3. Printful processes, prints, and ships the product
4. Webhook updates received on status changes
5. Customer receives tracking information

### Inventory Management

- Printful manages all inventory
- Stock levels sync automatically
- Out-of-stock variants are unavailable
- No manual stock management needed

## Database Schema

### printful_products

```sql
CREATE TABLE printful_products (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  site_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  printful_product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  printful_data TEXT NOT NULL, -- Full Printful product JSON
  synced_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER,
  updated_at INTEGER,
  UNIQUE (site_id, printful_product_id)
);
```

### printful_orders

```sql
CREATE TABLE printful_orders (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  site_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  order_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  printful_order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  printful_data TEXT NOT NULL, -- Full Printful order JSON
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  synced_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER,
  updated_at INTEGER,
  UNIQUE (site_id, order_id)
);
```

## API Reference

### PrintfulClient

```typescript
class PrintfulClient {
  // Products
  async getProducts(): Promise<PrintfulProduct[]>;
  async getProductById(productId: number): Promise<PrintfulProduct>;
  async getVariantById(variantId: number): Promise<PrintfulVariant>;

  // Orders
  async createOrder(orderRequest: PrintfulOrderRequest): Promise<PrintfulOrder>;
  async getOrder(orderId: number): Promise<PrintfulOrder>;
  async getOrders(): Promise<PrintfulOrder[]>;
  async cancelOrder(orderId: number): Promise<boolean>;

  // Store
  async getStore(): Promise<StoreInfo>;
}
```

### PrintfulService

```typescript
class PrintfulService {
  // Products
  async syncProducts(): Promise<PrintfulProduct[]>;
  async getProductDetails(productId: number): Promise<PrintfulProduct>;

  // Inventory
  async checkInventory(variantId: number): Promise<boolean>;

  // Orders
  async createOrderWithPrintful(orderRequest: PrintfulOrderRequest): Promise<PrintfulOrder>;
  async getOrderStatus(orderId: number): Promise<PrintfulOrder>;
  async cancelOrder(orderId: number): Promise<boolean>;
  async getAllOrders(): Promise<PrintfulOrder[]>;

  // Config
  getPrintfulConfig(): PrintfulServiceConfig;
  isConfigValid(): boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error               | Cause                           | Solution                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Invalid API Key`   | API key is incorrect or expired | Regenerate API key in Printful Dashboard     |
| `Product not found` | Printful product doesn't exist  | Verify product ID, re-sync products          |
| `Out of stock`      | Variant is out of stock         | Wait for restock or choose different variant |
| `Invalid order`     | Order data is malformed         | Check recipient address and item details     |
| `Network error`     | Can't reach Printful API        | Check internet connection, Printful status   |

### Retry Strategy

- **API Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Network Errors**: Retry up to 3 times
- **Order Webhooks**: Returned 200 immediately to prevent retries

## Security

### API Key Storage

- API keys are stored encrypted in the provider config
- Never committed to version control
- Only accessible to admin users
- Transmitted over HTTPS only

### Webhook Validation

- Webhook events are logged for audit trail
- Only process events from verified Printful
- All order changes logged to activity logs

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Integration Status

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-store.com/api/admin/printful/status?providerId=your-provider-id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Sync Products Manually

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-store.com/api/admin/printful/sync" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"providerId": "your-provider-id"}'
```

### View Activity Logs

All Printful activities are logged in the admin dashboard activity logs:

- Product syncs
- Order creation
- Order updates
- Status changes

## Limitations

- **Physical products only** - Printful doesn't support digital/service products
- **Printful pricing** - Store owners cannot manually adjust base costs (only markups)
- **Customization** - Only print areas (customization zones) supported, no text fields
- **No variants in our schema** - Variants are managed in Printful

## FAQ

### Q: How do I sync products automatically?

A: Currently sync is manual via the admin UI. You can also use the API endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/admin/printful/sync
```

Future versions will support automatic scheduled syncs.

### Q: Can I use multiple Printful accounts?

A: Yes! Create multiple Printful providers, each with different API keys.

### Q: What happens if a product goes out of stock?

A: The product becomes unavailable for purchase. Webhook updates reflect this change.

### Q: How do I handle returns/refunds?

A: Refunds are managed in Printful dashboard. Hermes will receive webhook updates.

### Q: Can I test without placing real orders?

A: Use Printful's sandbox API by providing a sandbox API key. Set up a development provider.
