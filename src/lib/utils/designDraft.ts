/**
 * Keeping a customer's design between visits, and giving it an identity.

 * Placing artwork carefully takes twenty minutes, and until now a stray refresh
 * threw all of it away. A draft is saved on the device — the shopper is
 * anonymous, so there is no account to hang it on — keyed by product, so two
 * products in the same store do not overwrite each other.
 *
 * Two things are stored that are not just geometry:
 *
 * - **An id**, generated once and kept for the life of the design. It rides
 *   along with the order, so when somebody adjusts their shirt and buys again
 *   the store sees revision two of one design rather than two unrelated orders.
 * - **A revision count**, which is what that number is read from.
 *
 * Uploaded pictures are the easy part here, unlike a studio with no server
 * behind it: an image element already points at its full-resolution original in
 * R2 by URL, so a restored draft shows the real artwork rather than a broken
 * `blob:` handle. Only the geometry and the URLs are written, never file bytes,
 * which is also why a draft stays comfortably inside the storage quota.
