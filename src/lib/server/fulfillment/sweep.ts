/**
 * The retry sweep: one pass over every relay whose backoff has elapsed.
 *
 * Cloudflare Queues would be the natural transport for this, but
 * @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare emits a fetch-only _worker.js, so neither a
 * queue consumer nor a Cron Trigger scheduled() handler has anywhere to
 * attach. The relay table is swept over HTTP instead, by
 * POST /api/cron/fulfillment-retry. See docs/FULFILLMENT_RELAY.md.
 *
 * The sweep is platform-wide: it reads due relays across all sites, and each
 * retry it starts is scoped by the site_id on the row it came from.
