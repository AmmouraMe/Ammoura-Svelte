## 🗄️ Database

The platform uses Cloudflare D1 for data persistence with full multi-tenant
support. Database migrations and seeding are automated:

- **Development**: Auto-migrates and seeds when running `npm run dev`
- **Preview**: Auto-migrates and seeds when running `npm run preview`
- **Production**: Auto-migrates when deploying (seeding is blocked for safety)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Create D1 database
wrangler d1 create hermes-db

# Update wrangler.toml with the database_id from above

# Setup database (migrate + seed for local dev)
npm run db:setup:local

# Or just run dev (database setup is automatic)
npm run dev
```

### Database Scripts

```bash
# Local development
npm run db:migrate:local    # Run migrations only
npm run db:seed:local       # Seed with sample data
npm run db:setup:local      # Both migrate and seed

# Production
npm run db:migrate          # Run migrations only (no seed)
npm run deploy              # Deploy and auto-migrate
```

database management guide.
